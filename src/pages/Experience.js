      EN4022: EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING <br/>
      This undergraduate module introduces students to various forms of educational technology providing them with the practical and pedagogical skills to integrate these technologies into their teaching. A core focus of the module is to empower participants to capitalise on the personal, social and educational benefits of technologies whilst recognising the critical questions raised by an increasingly technological society. As a module leader, I taught two hours of lectures to a group of approximately 280 students who would gather in an auditorium twice a week. In addition, I managed a team of two lab instructors who were responsible for teaching two hours of EN4022 tutorials to smaller groups of students. All exams, assignments and how each of them should be graded were also decided by the module leader. I had to deal with any issues concerning students and/or their performance in the module.

      <br/>
      
      This post-graduate module introduces students to educational research and its contribution to policy and practice. It outlines the different paradigms of research and supports students in exploring examples of significant research studies that have emerged from different perspectives. The module also presents a range of different research methodologies with examples. During this module, students begin to plan their overall research design for their thesis with ethical and practical considerations. As a module leader, I taught two hours of lectures to a group of approximately 90 students who would gather in an auditorium twice a week. All exams, assignments and how each of them should be graded were also responsibilities of mine. I had to deal with any issues concerning students and/or their performance in the module.

    <strong>INTERIM COURSE DIRECTOR – LM091: BACHELOR OF EDUCATION IN LANGUAGES</strong>
    <br/>
    The aim of this four-year programme is to educate teachers and equip them with the skills and aptitudes for a successful career as a languages teacher. Graduates from the programme are qualified to teach two chosen languages in Ireland at both Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate levels. The languages students can choose from are French, German, Japanese, Spanish and Irish. I dealt with queries from future students as applications for the first year of this programme were about to start when I was the interim course director. My most important contribution while in this position was to lead the Teaching Council accreditation of the programme (the professional body for teaching in Ireland, responsible for regulating the teaching profession and promoting professional standards in teaching). Important and thorough documentary evidence about the programme was produced, reviewed and made available to the Teaching Council to demonstrate that the programme was appropriate for accreditation. It was an extremely detailed work that was successfully completed with the support of a team of experts managed by me. In relation to this team, it was formed by experienced professionals such as course and department leaders from three different faculties.
